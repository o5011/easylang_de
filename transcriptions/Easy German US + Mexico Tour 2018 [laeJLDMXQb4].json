  "text": "Hallo Leute! Unfortunately, there's no new video today for you because we are on vacation. But we have a quick update in English for all our followers in the US and Mexico. What update? For November this year, the Easy German team is planning another tour to the US, this time also including Mexico. For about four weeks, we will travel both countries and meet you guys. And what will we do there? We will host Easy German meetups where you can meet us and practice your German with other German learners. We will also shoot new videos and you can suggest new topics and locations. And we'll visit schools and universities to do presentations and workshops for students that are learning German. And where exactly do we go? That depends on you because we'll go to those places with either the biggest German learning communities or the most creative and most interesting invitations. Within the next 10 days, you can fill a Google form in order to sign up for a possible meetup in your city, invite us to your school or university, or suggest a video shoot. At the end of the 10 days, we'll pick those five or six destinations that we'll visit in November. Click at the link below to sign up to our Google form. We can't wait to meet you in November. Let's go!"
