  "text": "Hello dear fans of Easy German back from Berlin with a short announcement today. You remember we have declared October to be the Easy German month. And yeah, we have posted one video per day. It was a lot of work. But it was so much fun that we want to keep doing this. And this is our announcement for today. From today, actually from last month, we'll keep producing one video of Easy German per week, per day. And to do so, we'll ask you for your support. And you have already helped us tremendously in the past weeks and months through the Patreon community. Patreon has become an incredibly helpful tool for us to help us have less worry on how to finance, for example, our studio rent, our camera equipment. And we would like to invite you to join us on Patreon. You can just join us with, for example, supporting us with one dollar per day and this dollar will be invested fully into our production. And we have one extra also for you. As you know, every day we have little extras in the videos. So we don't take in all the footage. We have some outtakes. And this is also a goodie we want to give for our Patreon community. So soon on Patreon, actually from this week, you'll find extra bonus material there. And this is for you as a way to say thank you. Thanks so much for supporting us and stay tuned for one German video per day."
